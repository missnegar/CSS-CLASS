## 🚀 Introduction

`CSS CLASS` is a powerful, all-in-one web-based toolkit designed to streamline the workflow of front-end developers and designers. It provides a suite of intuitive, visual generators for creating complex CSS effects, shapes, animations, and components. Instantly see your changes in a live preview and copy the production-ready HTML and CSS to your clipboard.

This project is built with a modern tech stack and focuses on a clean, intuitive, and highly interactive user experience.

## ✨ Features

`CSS CLASS` comes packed with a wide range of generators, each designed to tackle a common CSS task with ease and creativity.

*   **🎨 Shape Generator:** Create complex polygons by adding and dragging points, or generate organic "blob" shapes. Customize gradients, rotations, and corner styles. Download polygons as SVG.
*   **✨ Animated Text Generator:** Produce stunning animated SVG text with a vast library of effects from Animate.css, plus a unique, high-quality Glitch effect.
*   **🎬 Keyframe Animation Generator:** Visually build custom CSS `@keyframes` animations. Control transforms, opacity, and colors across multiple keyframes and get access to a library of presets.
*   **📐 Border Radius Generator:** Easily configure `border-radius` for all four corners of an element, together or individually.
*   **🕶️ Box Shadow Generator:** Design intricate `box-shadow` effects with full control over offset, blur, spread, color, opacity, and inset shadows.
*   **🔘 Button Generator:** A comprehensive tool to create beautiful, fully functional buttons. Customize text, fonts, padding, borders, gradients, shadows, and hover effects. Also generates the necessary `<a>` tag for links.
*   **✔️ Checkbox & Radio Generator:** Style custom, accessible checkboxes and radio buttons, controlling every aspect of their default and checked states.
*   **✂️ Clip Path Generator:** Visually create complex shapes using the `clip-path` property. Features an interactive polygon editor, presets for common shapes, and support for circles, ellipses, and insets.
*   **📰 Column Generator:** Effortlessly create multi-column text layouts. Control column count, width, gap, and the style of the separator rule.
*   **〰️ Cubic Bezier Generator:** Fine-tune your animation timings with an interactive `cubic-bezier` curve editor. Compare your custom curve against standard timing functions in a live preview.
*   **🖼️ Image Filter Generator:** Apply and chain multiple CSS filters to images. Includes controls for blur, brightness, contrast, hue-rotate, and more, plus a `drop-shadow` effect. Comes with a gallery of beautiful presets.
*   **🎚️ Flip Switch Generator:** Design creative and modern toggle switches. Choose from classic, icon-based (like sun/moon), or a 3D flip style with full customization.
